| 1 | pending | Please confirm that `00_human/` now serves as the sole human-facing entry point before Codex continues non-interactive work. |
| 2 | pending | Project core moved to `30_project/`; need a project entry (e.g., `30_project/inputs/index.yaml` or similar manifest listing required docs/stages) before generating new content—waiting on that file/fields (project name, required docs, constraints). |
