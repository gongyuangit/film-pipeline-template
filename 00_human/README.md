# Human Interaction Zone
Only `00_human/` needs manual review. Codex manages `10_codex/` (tools, scripts, automation) and `20_runtime/` (generated outputs); you can ignore them unless an inbox item requests attention.
All project content now lives under `30_project/`; treat this as the “project core” and only modify it after a decision in `INBOX.md`.
