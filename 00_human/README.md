# 00_human Quick Ops
- I only read `INBOX.md` and `NOW.md` for the pipeline status and what to do today.
- I only edit `APPROVALS.md` to approve gates; every other file is managed by Codex.
- New projects start by copying this template, setting `project_mode: project` in `30_project/inputs/index.yaml`, and running `python3 10_codex/tools/preflight.py`.
- After preflight, follow `NOW.md` for actionable gates and use `INBOX.md` for the full overview.
- Approvals lock files; do not edit other `00_human/` files outside these dashboards.
