# Film-level Lookdev Standards

This document defines the three pillars that every Lookdev Review must assess before a shot is signed off.

## Material Consistency
- High-resolution textures that hold up at close range without obvious tiling.
- Surface detail and microstructure must match the intended physical references.
- Materials must behave consistently with their physics (e.g., metallic values, roughness, subsurface scattering).

## Lighting & Exposure
- Light sources should be coherent with the scene’s key, fill, and rim intentions.
- Exposure must avoid clipped highlights or crushed shadows unless intentionally stylized.
- Light color temperature must stay within the intended palette, and reflections must respect the environment.

## Color Harmony & Grade
- Overall color balance should align with the cinematic grade idea (cold vs. warm vs. desaturated).
- Skin tones, fabrics, and key props must match reference swatches or style frames.
- Avoid banding, posterization, or oversaturated artifacts; gradients must be smooth.

Violations in any of these pillars must appear in `lookdev_review_v1.md` along with a severity (P0/P1/P2) and remediation note.
